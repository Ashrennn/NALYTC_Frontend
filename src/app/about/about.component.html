  <!-- Quiet by Design -->
  <section class="quiet-design">
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <h2>Quiet by Design</h2>
      <p>We are not a marketing company with technical offerings - we are a technical company with real-world infrastructure expertise.</p>
      <p>We operate quietly because great infrastructure doesn't draw attention - it performs consistently, scales predictably, and enables others to innovate.</p>
      <p>Our systems power AI labs, creative pipelines, developer platforms, and financial systems - often without our name attached. That's by design.</p>
